# What Should be a Function?

**2018-04-06 UPDATE** *Eventually I separated them into functions since they are so long that I found it hard to find a certain module in main().*

My attitude towards what should be a function changed just now when I was writing a Neural Network, where the main function looks like:

```
int main() {
    ... reading training data
    ... reading network cache
    
    while (...)
        ... learn
    
    ... free resources
}
```

If I wrote it several days ago, I would probably write these:

```
void readtdat() {
    ... reading training data
}

void readnw() {
    ... reading network cache
}

void learn() {
    ... learn
}

void freeres() {
    ... free resources
}

int main() {
    readtdat();
    readnew();
    
    while (...) learn();
    freeres();
}
```

Wow, the main function looks much prettier! But it just occured to me that if I read this code later, I will have to scroll up to the function definitions while I am reading the main function, which is annoying. At the same time, these function will be called only in the main function, once in the whole project, so there is unnecessary to pack them into individual functions.
