# To Think

We are losing the ability to think in this century since there are too much information that most of our time are spent importing new information, and thus we have little time to think, thus we have became mockingbirds.

It's ironic that the original title is To Think Independently. Well, are there really any thinking that is independent? We have to be influenced by the environment.
