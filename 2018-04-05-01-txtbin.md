I was writing a Neuron Network, and I came across a problem: use binary or text format for storing the network?

The Art of Unix Programming suggests that the text format can be checked anytime with a text editor, but I eventually chose the binary format since it is simpler: all I need is to mmap. I don't need to write structures and read/write functions.
