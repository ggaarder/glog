# Uninstalling IM

I've removed all fcitx files but every time I opened a new window gtk still gives me an error in the text virtual console running XOrg like:

```
(audacious:3749) Gtk-WARNING ** : /usr/lib64/gtk-3.0/3.0.0/immodules/im-fcitx.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

(audacious:3749) Gtk-WARNING ** : Loading IM context type 'fcitx' failed
```

Some others reported by an older one:

```
(terminal:2458) Gtk-WARNING ** : /usr/lib64/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/immodules/im-fcitx.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

(terminal:2458) Gtk-WARNING ** : Loading IM context type 'fcitx' failed
```

It's quite annoying. I firstly searched on the Internet but everyone is suggesting reinstalling like `apt-get install`. But I want to remove it! I then searched about how to configure "gtk modules" but got nothing. So I had to try it myself.

I cd'd to `/usr/lib64/gtk-3.0/3.0.0/immodules/`, which the error message reports, and it's quite a good help! I found a file `immodules.cache` containing these lines:

```
# GTK+ Input Method Modules file
# Automatically generated file, do not edit
# Created by gtk-query-immodules-3.0 from gtk+-3.8.2
...
"/usr/lib64/gtk-3.0/3.0.0/immodules/im-fcitx.so" 
"fcitx" "Fcitx (Flexible Input Method Framework)" "fcitx" "/usr/share/locale" "ja:ko:zh:*" 
```

Then I tried refreshing it, which works:

```
# gtk-query-immodules-3.0  > immodules.cache
```

After I did the same thing at the gtk-2.0 folder, I tried opening a new LXTerminal, and the error message disappeared! I'm just feeling great to have solved a problem on my own.
