# Shortnames

2018-04-01

I found that short names much more prettier and now all names I given are not
longer than eight characters, inspired by names of Unix commands, C Standard
Library functions and DOS's 8.3 filename style. Here are some comparsions for
the short names I created this weekend with their long version:

Repositories names:

- *glog* George Gaarder's Blog
- *clibwm* Backup for Webmonkey's c Library Reference
- *ssllc* Screenshots Lossless Compression
- *kdic* Kindle Dictionaries

Identifiers used in my C files:

- *toggledn* Change Endianness

Many codes after 2010 I read, especially in new languages like Java and Python,
use long names instead. Take pandas for example:

- add_prefix
- clip_lower
- combine_first
- sort_index
- value_counts

And Java:

- ServletRequest
- setContentType
- PrintWriter
- setDefaultCloseOperation
- setVisible

I don't know which is better. I'm just get used to the shortnames, and I like
them. It's a matter of style. The historical concern may be the low keyboard
speed and the short-naming habit from Mathematics.
